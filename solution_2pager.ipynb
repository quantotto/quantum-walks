    "# Random Walks with Quantum Galton Board\n",
    "\n",
    "State preparation is fundamental in Quantum Computing. In this work, we are using the technique suggested by the Universal Statistical Simulator paper to create variety of distributions in quantum state. The authors design a quantum version of Galton Board and demonstrate symmetric Gaussian as well as some biased distributions. Their approach results in a superposition of Hamming Weight ($HW$) 1 states. In case of the uniform distribution, they are called W states or a private case of Dicke states with $HW=1$. Those states are entangled and can be a resource in different algorithms (quantum cryptography, differential equations, optimization problems). Our solution allows any distribution to be encoded with Hamming Weight 1 states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will generalize the model to the $n$-level Galton Board and demonstrate Gaussian on noiseless simulator. We will then show that quantum pegs and a coin can be modified to output different distributions, such as Exponential or Hadamard Random Walk."
